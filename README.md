With quick games for less than 5 minutes, let's determine who pays the latte for the afterparty.

The goal of the game is to assemble technologist members, tools and techniques to score more points than your opponents.

The rules are simple:

- Draw a card.
- Play a card.

1 card at a time, turns are quick and easy, but will you keep track of the points until the 8th round ?
