# Spooky Bevy Jam #1

codename SBJ-1

## Public reach

Prize offered for the bevy [spooky jam in octobre 2024](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-spooky-jam).

## Theme

This edition is themed around halloween:

- Members are more fictive than usual.
an opportunity to showcase mascots from different rust-related projects.
- Crates are focused on crates evoking a halloween theme.
- Techniques are evoking arbirtary difficult or controversial concepts in Rust, to evoke "fear".

Despite the jam being bevy-focused, the focus is not much on bevy, because it's difficult enough to theme around bevy.
See [bevy edition](../2024_11/) for a bevy edition.

### Special card

This edition opens the idea of having "imaginary" members.

## Release plan

The deck is a exclusive to the Bevy Spooky game jam for some time (1 year?). Eventually to be released on the buying platform.
