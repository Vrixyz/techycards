# Bevy #1

## Public reach

Showcased only to friends and family, I'm currently trying out Print-On-Demand solutions (drivethrucards, launchtabletop, local printers...).

- TODO: add link to store when it's ready.

## Theme

That's the first edition which served as a prototype, it's themed around [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

### Special card

This edition contained a special card "open source":

The card "open source" is visible from both sides, a rare twist in card games.

## Release plan

The special card "open source" is also a reference to the whole game going open source.
