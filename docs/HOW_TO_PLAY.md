# How to play

## Setup

Distribute 12 cards per player, they make up the "draw pile" of each players.

Each player get 2 cards in their hand from their draw pile, they can look at them but keep them hidden from other players.

First player is the one who had least points last round, or has started contributing to open source most recently, or is the youngest, make up your own rule then.

Decide on a direction to play, each players will play turn by turn.

Each player must have room to lay out 3 lines of cards, corresponding to the cards' categories (techniques, tools and members).

## Turns

First draw a card.

Play a card from your hand, place it on the rightest line of its category line, and follow its instructions.

## Specific keywords

- "Hide" a card: a card in play is turned face down, it is now a "hidden" card. Its points do not count towards the total points.
- "Activate": say the name of a card, then reveal a hidden card. If the name doesn't match it, you discard the card you revealed, otherwise, you apply their effect as if you just played it (it keeps previous modifications).

## Victory

- At the end of the 8th turn: the game ends.
- For each category, count their points, players with most points win the category.
  - Hidden cards do not count towards the total points, their descriptions are not applied.
- The player winning most categories wins the game!
  - The total points can be used for tiebreaks
  - ... Or you can analyze if the played cards make sense together and judge the winner based on that!

### Continued

To add a strategy layer, a 3 rounds approach is preferred for tournaments:

Start with 30 cards in each draw pile.

Players who lose can keep a card from their hand for the next game.

Discard pile, hand and hidden cards are shuffled back into the draw pile

Visible cards are banned from the next game, put them in a dedicated "banned pile".

Final win is when a player has 2 wins.

## Additional notes

If a card description conflicts against these rules, the card description should be the priority. If 2 cards are conflicting, the last played or activated card should be the priority.

Rules are sometimes complicated and if you think they are ambiguous, [please open an issue](https://github.com/Vrixyz/techycards/issues)!

If a rule can be interprated in an advantageous way for the player playing the card, this interpretation takes priority.

Adapt the rules to have fun, and discuss the cards, did you know all those names before?
