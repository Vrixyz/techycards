# How to play

## Setup

Distribute 15 cards per player, they make up the "draw pile" of each players.

Each player get 2 cards in their hand from their draw pile, they can look at them but keep them hidden from other players.

First player is the one who had least points last round, or has started contributing to open source most recently, or is the youngest, make up your own rule then.

Decide on a direction to play, each players will play turn by turn.

Each player must have room to lay out 3 lines of cards, corresponding to the cards' categories (techniques, tools and members).

## Turns

First draw a card.

Play a card from your hand, place it on the rightest line of its category line, and follow its instructions.

## Specific keywords

- "Hide" a card: a card in play is turned face down, it is now a "hidden" card. Its points do not count towards the total points.
- "Activate": say the name of a card, then reveal a hidden card. If the name doesn't match it, you discard the card you revealed, otherwise, you apply their effect as if you just played it (it keeps previous modifications).

## Victory

At the 8th turn, you must not play and shout "Ship it!": the game ends. If a player notices the rule wasn't followed, all offending players must discard 1 visible member.

Player who has the most categories with the most points wins, or the player who shouted "Ship it!".

Hidden cards do not count towards the total points, their descriptions are not applied.

Players who lose can keep a card from their hand for the next game.

Discard pile, hand and hidden cards are shuffled back into the draw pile

Visible cards are banned from the next game, put them in a dedicated "banned pile".

Final win is when a player has 2 wins.

## Additional notes

If a card description conflicts against these rules, the card description should be the priority. If 2 cards are conflicting, the last played or activated card should be the priority.
